# Specifications

## Experiences

### End-user Experience

Fix and test one problem at a time.

```console
$ git clone this-repo-url
$ cd merge-conflict-exercises
$ cd problems/problem-1
$ make generate  # generate merge conflicts
$ # fixing the merge conflict(s)
$ make test  # build test cases and run them.
```

### CI/CD Experience

Test all problems.

```console
$ cd problems && make testAll
```

Testing arbitrary set of problems.

```console
$ cd problems && make p1 p2 p5
```

### TA Experience

```console
$ # fixing / creating new problem
$ python generator.py p1
```

## Limitations

- Helper program, if needed, have to be written in C++ only. Python would be ideal but studets will have to install Python runtime.
- Build system is limited to only Make. This is because class content only cover Make.

## Project Structure

```plain
problems/
problems/Makefile
problems/common/
problems/common/vendors/
problems/common/vendors/catch2/catch.hpp # from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/catchorg/Catch2/v2.x/single_include/catch2/catch.hpp
problems/p1/
problems/p1/Makefile
problems/p1/.template/
problems/p1/.template/filename.common.suffix
problems/p1/.template/filename.ours.suffix
problems/p1/.template/filename.theirs.suffix
problems/p1/.template/Makefile.common  # support for generating merge conflicts in Makefile ?
problems/p1/.template/Makefile.ours
problems/p1/.template/Makefile.theirs
problems/p1/test_main.cpp
```

```makefile
# p1/Makefile
help:
  @echo "usage: make [command]"
 
generate:
  @echo "generate merge conflcit(s)"
  # Steps
  # 1. Copy catch.hpp into this directory
  # 2. Copy non-conflict files into working directory
  # 3. Create merge conflicts for each file that has them.

test:
  @echo "test"
  # Steps
  # 1. Compile source files.
  # 1. Compile test cases under tests/
  # 2. Run test

clean:
  @echo "removing build artifacts"

reset:
  @echo "resetting workspace"
  # TODO(KC): Add confirmation prompt.
```

### generator.py Idea

Initially, using `generator.py` to automatically generate merge conflicts seem to be good idea, but currently manually
write `generate` taget for each problem seems feasible enough.
